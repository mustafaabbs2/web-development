# NoteTaker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# Repo Structure

- `public\` : This directory typically contains static assets that are publicly accessible, such as HTML files, images, and other resources. Files in this directory are served as-is to the client.
- `src\`: The src directory is where the main source code of the project resides. It usually includes the JavaScript code, CSS stylesheets, and other assets needed to build the application.
- `package.json` : The `package.json` file is a metadata file for the project. It includes information about the project, such as its name, version, dependencies, and scripts. This file is commonly used in Node.js projects to manage dependencies and configure project settings.

Within `src\`, you find:
- `App.js`: This file likely serves as the main component or entry point of the React application. It may contain the root component of the application, where other components are rendered.

- `index.js`: The index.js file is typically the entry point of the React application. It is responsible for rendering the root component of the application into the DOM and bootstrapping the React application.

- `components\`: The components directory contains reusable UI components that are used throughout the application. These components are typically modular and encapsulate a specific piece of functionality or user interface element.

- `services\`: The services directory may contain utility functions, API services, or other helper modules used by the application. This directory is often used to separate concerns and keep the codebase organized.
